Jekyll-Scholar
==============

Jekyll-Scholar is for all the academic bloggers out there. It is a set of
extensions to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the awesome, blog aware, static
site generator; it formats your bibliographies and reading lists for the web
and gives your blog posts citation super-powers.

For additional features you may also want to take a look at
[jekyll-scholar-extras](https://github.com/hdpatel/jekyll-scholar-extras).


Installation
------------

    $ [sudo] gem install jekyll-scholar


Usage
-----

Install and setup a new [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) directory (see the
[Jekyll-Wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Usage) for detailed
instructions). To enable the Jekyll-Scholar add the following statement
to a file in your plugin directory (e.g., to `_plugins/ext.rb`):

    require 'jekyll/scholar'

In your configuration you can now adjust the Jekyll-Scholar settings. The
default configuration is as follows:

    scholar:
      style: apa
      locale: en
      
      sort_by: none
      order: ascending
      
      source: ./_bibliography
      bibliography: references.bib
      
      details_dir:    bibliography
      details_layout: bibtex.html
      details_link:   Details
      
      query: "@*"  

You can use any style that ships with
[CiteProc-Ruby](https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby) by name (e.g.,
apa, mla, chicago-fullnote-bibliography), or else you can add a link
to any CSL style (e.g., you could link to any of the styles available at
the official [CSL style repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles)).

The `locale` settings defines what language to use when formatting
your references (this typically applies to localized terms, e.g., 'Eds.' for
editors in English).

The `source` option indicates where your bibliographies are stored;
`bibliography` is the name of your default bibliography.


### Bibliographies

Once you have loaded Jekyll-Scholar, all files with the extension `.bib` or
`.bibtex` will be converted when you run Jekyll (don't forget to add a YAML
header to the files); the file can contain regular HTML or Markdown and
BibTeX entries; the latter will be formatted by Jekyll-Scholar according to
the citation style and language defined in your configuration file.

For example, if you had a file `bibliography.bib` in your root directory:

    ---
    ---
    References
    ==========
    
    @book{ruby,
      title     = {The Ruby Programming Language},
      author    = {Flanagan, David and Matsumoto, Yukihiro},
      year      = {2008},
      publisher = {O'Reilly Media}
    }

It would be converted to `bibliography.html` with the following content:

    <h1 id='references'>References</h1>

    <p>Flanagan, D., &#38; Matsumoto, Y. (2008). <i>The Ruby Programming Language</i>. O&#8217;Reilly Media.</p>

This makes it very easy for you to add your bibliography to your Jekyll-powered
blog or website.

If your using other converters to generate your site, don't worry, you can
still generate bibliographies using the `bibliography` tag. In your site
or blog post, simply call:

    {% bibliography %}

This will generate your default bibliography; if you use multiple, you can
also pass in a name to tell Jekyll-Scholar which bibliography it should render.

Let's say you have two bibliographies stored in `_bibliography/books.bib` and
`_bibliography/papers.bib`; you can include the bibliographies on your site
by respectively calling `{% bibliography --file books %}` and
`{% bibliography --file papers %}`. For example, you could have a file `references.md`
with several reference lists:

    ---
    title: My References
    ---

    {{ page.title }}
    ================

    The default Bibliography
    ------------------------

    {% bibliography %}

    Secondary References
    --------------------

    {% bibliography --file secondary %}

Finally, the bibliography tag supports an optional filter parameter. This
filter takes precedence over the global filter defined in your configuration.

    {% bibliography --query @*[year=2013] %}

The example above would print a bibliography of all entires published in
the year 2013. Of course you can also combine the file and filter parameters
like this:

    {% bibliography --file secondary --query @*[year=2013] %}

This would print the publications from 2013 of the bibliography at
`_bibliography/secondary.bib`.

For more details about filters, see the corresponding section below or
consult the [BibTeX-Ruby](https://github.com/inukshuk/bibtex-ruby)
documentation.


### Citations

If you want to reference books or papers from your bibliography in your blog
posts, Jekyll-Scholar can help you, too. Simply use the `cite` tag with
the appropriate key of the item you want to cite and Jekyll-Scholar will
create a formatted citation reference for you. For a quick example, take
following blog post:

    ---
    layout: default
    title: A Blogging Scholar
    ---

    {{ page.title }}
    ================

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
    incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
    nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
    Duis 'aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate' {% cite derrida:purveyor %}
    velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat
    cupidatat non proident, 'sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est
    laborum' {% cite rabinowitz %}.

    Duis 'aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate' {% cite breton:surrealism %}
    velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat
    cupidatat non proident, 'sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est
    laborum' {% cite rainey %}.

    References
    ----------

    {% bibliography %}

Note that this will print your entire bibliography in the Reference section.
If you would like to include only those entries you cited on the page, pass
the `cited` option to the bibliography tag:

    {% bibliography --cited %}

For longer quotes, Jekyll-Scholar provides a `quote` tag:

    {% quote derrida:purveyor %}
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
    sed do eiusmod tempor.
    
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.
    {% endquote %}

For example, this could be rendered as:

    <blockquote>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,<br/>
      sed do eiusmod tempor.</p>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.</p>
      <cite>
        <a href="#derrida:purveyor">(Derrida, 1975)</a>
      </cite>
    </blockquote>

#### Displaying formatted references

If you want to display the full formatted reference entry, you can use the
`reference` tag. For example, given the following Bibtex entry,

    @book{ruby,
      title     = {The Ruby Programming Language},
      author    = {Flanagan, David and Matsumoto, Yukihiro},
      year      = {2008},
      publisher = {O'Reilly Media}
    }

using `{% reference ruby %}` anywhere in your page, it will print
"Flanagan, D., & Matsumoto, Y. (2008). *The Ruby Programming Language.*.
O'Reilly Media" (the exact result depends on your formatting style).

The `reference` tag accepts a second optional argument that specifies the
absolute path of the BibTeX file to use as input. Using it, you can override
the file from which the bib entries are read. This can be handy if you
want to use a special BibTeX file as input for a specific page. As an example,
the tag

    {% reference ruby --file /home/foo/bar.bib %}

will attempt to read the key `ruby` from file `/home/foo/bar.bib`. It will not
fallback to the default BibTeX file.

#### Citations to multiple bibliographies within one document (like [multibib.sty](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/multibib))

When you have multiple `{% bibliography %}` sections in one file,
Jekyll-Scholar will generate serveral lists containing the same
publications that have the same `id` attributes. As a result, when you
cite a reference the link to an `id` attribute cannot be resolved
uniquely. Your browser will always take you take you to the first
occurence of the `id`. Moreover, valid HTML requires unique `id`
attributes. This scenario may happen, for example, if you cite the
same reference in different blog posts, and all of these posts are
shown in one html document.

As a solution, Jekyll-Scholar provides the `--prefix` tag. In your
first post you might cite as 

	---
	title: Post 1
	---
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
    incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
    nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
    Duis 'aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate' 
	{% cite derrida:purveyor --prefix post1 %} velit esse cillum
    dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat
    non proident, 'sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id
    est laborum' {% cite rabinowitz --prefix post1 %}.

    References
    ----------

    {% bibliography --cited --prefix post1 %}


For the second blog post you would cite as follows:

	---
	title: Post 2
	---
    Duis 'aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate' 
	{% cite rabinowitz --prefix post2 %} velit esse cillum
    dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat
    non proident, 'sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id
    est laborum' {% cite rainey --prefix post2  %}.

    References
    ----------

    {% bibliography --cited --prefix post2 %}

Even though both posts cite rabinowitz, both citations will be
assigned unique identifiers linking to the respective References
section., even if both posts will be rendered into a single HTML
document.


### Detail Pages

If your layouts directory contains a layout file for bibliography details
(the 'details_layout' configuration options), Jekyll-Scholar will generate
a details page for each entry in you main bibliography. That is to say, if
your bibliography contains the following entry:

    @book{ruby,
      title     = {The Ruby Programming Language},
      author    = {Flanagan, David and Matsumoto, Yukihiro},
      year      = {2008},
      publisher = {O'Reilly Media}
    }

Then a page 'bibliography/ruby.html' will be generated according to your
details page layout. In the layout file, you have access to all fields
of your BibTeX entry. Here is an example of a details page layout:

    ---
    ---
    <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
      <h1>{{ page.entry.title }}</h1>
      <h2>{{ page.entry.author }}</h2>
      <p>{{ page.entry.abstract }}</p>
    </body>
    </html>

When Jekyll-Scholar generates detail pages, it also adds links to each
entry's detail page to the generated bibliography. You can alter the
name of the link via the 'details_link' configuration option.

Jekyll-Scholar also provides a Liquid tag for conveniently adding links
to individual detail pages. For example, if you would like to add a simple
link to one of the items in your bibliography on a page or in a blog post
you can use the `cite_details` tag to generate the link. For this to work,
you need to pass the BibTeX key of the element you want to reference to
the tag and, optionally, provide a text for the link (the default text
can be set via the 'details_link' configuration option).

    Duis 'aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate' velit esse cillum
    dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non
    proident {% cite_details key --text Click Here For More Details %}.


### Bibliography Filters

By default, Jekyll-Scholar includes all entries in you main BibTeX file
when generating bibliographies. If you want to include only those entries
matching certain criteria, you can do so by adjusting the 'query'
configuration option. For example:

    query: "@book" #=> includes only books
    query: "@article[year>=2003]" #=> includes only articles published 2003 or later
    query: "@*[url]" #=> includes all entries with a url field
    query: "@*[status!=review]" #=> includes all entries whose status field is not set to 'review' 
    query: "@book[year <= 1900 && author ^= Poe]" #=> Books published before 1900 where the author matches /Poe/ 
    
Please note that some of these queries require bibtex-ruby 2.0.7 or
later versions. You can also overwrite the configuration's query parameter
in each bibliography tag individually as described above.
