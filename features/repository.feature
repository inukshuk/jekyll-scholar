Feature: PDF Repository
  As a scholar who likes to blog
  I want to publish my BibTeX bibliography on my blog
  And I want Jekyll to generate links to PDFs of my references automatically

  @repository
  Scenario: A bibliography with a single entry and a repository
    Given I have a scholar configuration with:
      | key                   | value             |
      | source                | ./_bibliography   |
      | repository            | papers            |
      | bibliography_template | bibliography      |
    And I have a "_bibliography" directory
    And I have a file "_bibliography/references.bib":
      """
      @book{ruby,
        title     = {The Ruby Programming Language},
        author    = {Flanagan, David and Matsumoto, Yukihiro},
        year      = {2008},
        publisher = {O'Reilly Media}
      }

    And I have a "papers" directory

    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist

    And I should see "The Ruby Programming Language" in "_site/scholar.html"
    And I should see "Link: /papers/ruby.pdf" in "_site/scholar.html"
