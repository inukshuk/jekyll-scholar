Feature: Interpolations ...
  As a scholar who likes to blog
  I want to reference cool papers and books from my bibliography

  @tags @reference @liquid @interpolate
  Scenario: Interpolate liquid variables
    Given I have a scholar configuration with:
      | key                | value             |
      | source             | ./_bibliography   |
      | bibliography       | my_references     |
    And I have a "_bibliography" directory
    And I have a file "_bibliography/my_references.bib":
      """
      @book{ruby,
        title     = {The Ruby Programming Language},
        author    = {Flanagan, David and Matsumoto, Yukihiro},
        year      = {2008},
        publisher = {O'Reilly Media}
      }
      """
    And I have a file "custom.csl":
      """
      <style>
        <citation>
          <layout>
            <text variable="title"/>

    And I have a page "scholar.html":

      {% assign style_file = 'custom.csl' %}
      {% bibliography --style {{style_file}} %}
      """
    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist
    And the "_site/scholar.html" file should exist
    And I should see "The Ruby Programming Language" in "_site/scholar.html"
 

  @tags @grouping
  Scenario: Local grouping override - grouping by year with interpolation
    Given I have a scholar configuration with:
      | key         | value             |
      | group_by    | none              |
      | group_order | ascending         |
    And I have a "_bibliography" directory
    And I have a file "_bibliography/references.bib":
      """
